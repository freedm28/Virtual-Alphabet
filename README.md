# Virtual Alphabet

Virtual Alphabet is a learning game made by Joe Freedman, Alex Lambert, and Noah Hirvela at Spartahack 2015, a Hackathon at Michigan State University. It combines the use of Gamemaker, Myo Armband, and Firebase API to save a local and global high score table. The best part about Virtual Alphabet is the fact that the user gets to have fun by playing the game and won't even realize they are learning at the same time!

To play:

1. Open Myo Connect
2. Connect Myo through the Armband Manager
2.5. It is recommended, though not required to custom calibrate the Myo armband to the user's gestures
3. Navigate to the Application Manager and add the virtual-alphabet.lua file and click the "refresh" logo
4. Open the virtual-alphabet.exe file
5. Use the double tap gesture to unlock the Myo
6. Use the fist gesture to enable mouse control and navigate menus
7. Use the spread fingers gesture to simulate a mouse click and click "play"
8. Follow and trace the letters, but don't hit the fireballs! Hitting 2 fireballs will reset the level
